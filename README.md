# Pairs Trading Algo Implemented in Python ðŸ’¯

This project implements a pairs trading strategy using Python. Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves matching a long position with a short position in two stocks with a high correlation. The strategy aims to profit from the relative price movements of the two stocks.

During my 'analysis' i found 2 pairs of highly cointegrated stocks for 2 different timeframes and applied pairs trading stratergy to them the results found are inside the nodebook and the backtesting report.
